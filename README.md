### The Project:
The project hereby presented, tackles an image classification problem for detecting brain tumor in images with the help of Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This project is a partial requirement for the course Applied Artificial Intelligence (D7041E), held as part of the International Master’s Program in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Luleå University of Technology (LTU), fall 2023. 

### Original Datasets:

NOTE: As part of our pre-processing steps, we cut down the size of the original dataset and created a new structured of the folders for train and test sets. The subsets used by us are under the respective folders for the two different implementations that we did, i.e. "implementation01" and "implementation02".
